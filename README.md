  For a new programming language, there are a couple of standard things you should try to implement.

    Write several programs where you

      Read/write to a file

      Turn a structured object into JSON

      Parse JSON into an object

      A basic script that can be run from the CLI, parses flags/args, reads stdin

      Send a HTTP request

      Implement a very basic web server

  When youâ€™re doing these exercises, do not copy/paste any code.

  You should be typing out the code yourself.
